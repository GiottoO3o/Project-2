1 Problem Statement
Design and implement an application for a Health and Fitness Club Management System. This system will serve
as a comprehensive platform catering to the diverse needs of club members, trainers, and administrative staff.
Members should be able to register and manage their profiles, establish personal fitness goals (you can
determine suitable fitness goals such as weight and time, and members will set the values), and input health
metrics. They should have access to a personalized dashboard that tracks exercise routines, fitness achievements,
and health statistics. Members can schedule, reschedule, or cancel personal training sessions with certified
trainers. Additionally, they should be able to register for group fitness classes.
Trainers should have the ability to manage their schedules and view member profiles.
Administrative Staff should be equipped with features to manage room bookings, monitor fitness equipment
maintenance, update class schedules, oversee billing, and process payments for membership fees, personal
training sessions, and other services.
Functions to Implement:
Member Functions:
1. User Registration
2. Profile Management (Updating personal information, fitness goals, health metrics)
3. Dashboard Display (Displaying exercise routines, fitness achievements, health statistics)
4. Schedule Management (Scheduling personal training sessions or group fitness classes. The system
must ensure that the trainer is available)
Trainer Functions:
1. Schedule Management (Trainer can set the time for which they are available.)
2. Member Profile Viewing (Search by Memberâ€™s name)
Administrative Staff Functions:
1. Room Booking Management
2. Equipment Maintenance Monitoring
3. Class Schedule Updating
4. Billing and Payment Processing (Your system should assume integration with a payment service
[Note: Do not actually integrate with a payment service])
You are not required to demonstrate the entire sequence of operations, but rather focus on individual operations.
For instance, when a new member joins, the subsequent step involves scheduling a session. Following that, the
system generates a bill, the member makes a payment, and then the system confirms the transaction. I do not
anticipate you to follow this sequence explicitly. Instead, I only need you to provide an operation (function) in
your code along with its corresponding SQL code. You are encouraged to test these functions separately in your
demo video.
